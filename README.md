# Mission-to-Mars

I have been tasked with creating a web app for Robin, who would like to admire images of Mars and its hemispheres. In order to do this I utilized BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database and then use a web application to display the data, and finally alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
